#Hack-A-Thon

The hack-a-thon will be open to any person under the age of 21, enrolled in high school or in an undergradtuate program. Teams must consist of 50% participants who self-identify as non-male.

The hack-a-thon will probably be modified. Students will not be staying overnight. Security costs and parental permission too much to negotiate.
