Dear {Insert Field}

As president of the Southern Connecticut State University Computer Science Club I am dedicated to addressing diversity issues in technology. I know you share our committment. Our current initiative focues on getting more women involved in the greater New Haven Tech scene. We wanted to inquiy if {Insert compant} wants to be a partner in these efforts.

This April we will host our first annual hackathon. The goals of this  years #femhack are to promote young women’s development of skills related to computer programming and give proper guidance for their future endeavors. We are currently planning to have the event April 16th from 9:00AM-4:00PM at SCSU. 
The hackathon is part of the youth programming at the [22nd Women's Studies Conference: #FeministIn(ter)ventions: Women, Community, Technology](http://southernct.edu/academics/schools/arts/departments/womensstudies/annualconference). 

The hackathon is 100% community funded and we need your help. Funds raised will first go to providing free team registration for area youth, sanck and food for particiapnts, prize money for winners, and any remianing funds will be used to defray the costs of guest judges.
